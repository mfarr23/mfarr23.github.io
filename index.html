			My name is Michael Farrelly and I am studying to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. So far I have studied computer programming languages such as html and css as well as programs like terminal and github. I hope to work as a developer upon completing the class.

			The text and formatting of this page is based on a 15 inch mac. The page does not have proper responsive web design so the page will look abnormal on screens smaller than 15 inches. I hope to change that in the next assignment by using Bootstrap.
